# CCM-Core
A lightweight module for managing SCCM resources and collections that relies on CIM cmdlets and is compatible with PowerShell 6.0

Purpose:
* Get-WMIObject is deprecated and isn't currently in PowerShell 6.0, show how to use CIM cmdlets (wmi 2.0)
* Provide a faster, lightweight alternative to the Microsoft SCCM module
* Allow more complex WQL filtering than is offered by the SCCM module

Design Goals:
* When possible, return a cmdlet's default output type. Return cim instances, and avoid custom object types (no PSObjects)
	* All output should work with built-in CIM functionality - Get-CimInstance, Set-CimInstance, Remove-CimInstance, Invoke-CimMethod should work with output
* Every function should have Filter and Property parameters
* Use format and type files to manipulate output without changing object types
